Forge mod for anarchy servers. (1.12.2)

Q: **What is this?**

A: This a forge mod I worked on a while back, I was interested in anarchy mod development and decided to have some fun at it. 

Q: **Is this 'custom base' or 'pasted'?**

A: It's a bit of both. Some modules / other features were pasted and some of it was written myself. (Yes, I wrote @author zzurio on every class because it's my client what do you expect lol.)

Q: **Is this a rat?**

A: No.

Q: **Why did I paste some features?**

A: This was a lazy attempt at making an anarchy client, I got bored really fast hence why I'm open sourcing this project.

Q: **Can I skid this / use this in my project?**

A: Yes, you can use this in any form you want I do not care, some credit would be nice but it does not matter to me. 

Shoutout Paupro for trying to learn a thing or two whilst I maintained this project.
